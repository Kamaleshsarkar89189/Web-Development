HTML 
Hypertext Markup Language. It is a standard markup language that's used to create web pages
that are displayed in browsers.

HTML webpages are written in the form of HTML elements. HTML can be made more interactive and 
attractive by using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) within it. 

HTML tags are keywords on a web page that define how the web browser should format and display
 the page. Almost all tags have two parts, an opening tag and a closing tag. For example,
  <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag

  The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", 
  first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. 



  We start bulding a website by creating a file named index.html ,index.html is a 
  specific filename which is presented when the website root address is typed.

  A basic html page

    <! Doctype html>  ---> specific this is an html document
    <html> ---> root of an HTML page
    <head> ---> Contain page metadata

    </head>
    <body> --->The main page of the page 
    <h1> This is a heading </h1> ---> heading tag

The Heading Tags
    Heading tag is used to mark heading in html. From h1 to h6, we have tags for the most 
    impotant to the least important Heading


        <h1> Most important heading</h1>
        <h2> Another heading h2   </h2>
        <h3> Another heading</h3>
        <h4> Another heading</h4>
        <h5> Another heading</h5>
        <h6> Another heading</h6>

        Note : We should not use HTML heading to make text thick or bold

             using pre          --->
             tag

Creating a page layout

    When we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page layout, better indexing by 
    search engines.We use the following tag get the job done 

    <header>   -->contains nav tag
    <main>       Website layout
    <footer>

Inside the main tag we insert the following tags:

    <main>  ---> This main opening tag
    <section> ---> a page section
    <article> ---> a self contained content
    <aside> ---> content aside from the content(eg Ads etc)
    </main> ---> The main closing tag

Link attributes
<a href = "/open"> Open </a> --> open page opened in same tab
<a href = "/open" target="_blank"> open </a> -->open in a new tag

We can put any content inside an anchor tag (image, heading etc are all allowed)


We can add links to image like this

    <a href = "/about"> <image src='image.jpg' widht= "120"> </a>  -->Height will be set automatically
