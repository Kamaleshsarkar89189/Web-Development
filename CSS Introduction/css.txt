CSS Tutorial for beginners

Instruction to css

HTML is just a skeletal layout of a website. We need css to design a website add style to it and make it look beautiful. 

What is CSS?
Css stands for cascading style sheets. Css is optional but it convert an off looking HTML page into a beautiful and & responsible website.

Installing vs code
We will use Microsoft Visual Studios Code as a tool to edit our code. It is very powerful, free and customizable.

Why learn css?
Css is a very demanded skill in the world of web development. If you are successfully like to master css, you can customize your website as per your liking.

Your first line of css
Create a css file inside your directory and add it to your HTML. Add the following line to your css body {

Background- color: red;
This will made your page background as red. 







Chapter 1- creating our first css website

We will create our first css website in this section.

What is DOM?
DOM stand for document object model when a page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page which is constructed as a tree of objects.

HTML ID and class attributes
When an html element is given an id, it serves as a unique identifier for that element 
On the other hand, when an html element is given a class, it now belongs to a single class but every element must have a unique id ( assigned).
 We can add multiple classes to an element like this 
<div id=”first” class=”c1 c2 c3”>
</div>

Three ways to add CSS to HTML
1. <style > tag – adding <style>…</style> to html
2. Inline css- adding css using style attribute
3. External css- adding a stylesheet (.css) to html sing <link>tag

Css  selectors
A css selectors is used to select an html elements for styling
Body (selector) {
Color: red;    Declaration( properly : value)
Background: pink; 
Declaration


Element selection
It is used to select an element based off the tag name

For example:
H2 { color: blue;
}

Id selection 
It is used to select an element with a given id 
For example:
#first {
 Color: white;
Background: black;

Class selection 
It is used to select an element with a given class
For example:
.red {background: red;}

Important Notes:
We can group select that like this :
H1,h2.h3,div  {
Color : blue;} (h1,h2,h3 and div will be blue
We can use element class as a selection like this:

P.red {
       Color : red; ( all paragraph of class-red will get color of red
*  Can be used as a universal selector to select all the elements


* {
   Margin : o ;
Padding : 0 ;
}
An inline style will override external and internal styles

Comments in css
Comment in css is text which is not parse and is thus ignored
Chapter 2- colors & Background
CSS rules are simple key- value pairs with a selector. We can write css rule to change color and set backgrounds.

The color property
The css color property can be used to set the text color inside an element
P {
  Color : red; ( Text color will be changed to red )
Similarly we can set color for different elements

Types of color values
Following are the most commonly used color value in css
1. RGB- Specify color using Red, green, blue values eg.rgb( 200,98, 70 )
2. HEX CODE- Specify color using hex code.
                   eg. #ff7189
3. HSL- Specify the color using hsl values (hsl full form-hue, saturation, lightness)
    eg hsl (8%, 90%, 63% ).
The value of the color or background color is provided as any one of these values.

Note : We also have an RGBA and HSLA value for color but they are rarely used by beginners a stands for alpha. 
The background color property
The css background color property specifies the background color of a container.
For eg :
                 Brown {
                         Background-color : brown ; ( can be other types of color as well )


The background-image property
Used to set an image as the background.
Body {
     Background-image : url ( “kisan.jpg”)
The image is by default repeated in X & Y direction

The background-repeat property 
Can be any of :
Repeat-X = repeat in horizontal direction 
Repeat –Y = repeat in vertical direction 
No-repeat = image not repeat
See more possible value at MDN docs

The background size property 
Can be following :
Cover – fits & no empty space remains
Contain – fits & image is fully visible
Auto – display in original size
{{ width}} – set width & height will be set automatically 
{{ width}} {{ height }} – set width & height 

Note: Always check the MDN docs to dissect a given css property. Remember, practice will make you perfect.
The background-position property
 Sets the starting position of a background image.
.div {
     Background- position: left top;
}

The background attachment property 
Defines a scrollable/non scrollable character of a background image.
.div {
   Background-attachment: fixed; (Always check MDN docs)
        }
 The background shorthand property
 A single property to set multiple background properties 
.div 3 {    
      Background: red[color] url( img.png) no-repeat fixed[attachment] right top[position];
*One of the property can be missing given the others are in order.










 
Chapter 3 – CSS Box Model
 The css box model looks at all the HTML element as boxes


Setting width and height
We can set width and height in css as follows 
#box {
   Height  : 70 px;
   Width : 70 px;
        }

Note that the total width/height is calculated as follows:
Total height = height + top/bottom padding + top/bottom border + top/bottom margin

Setting margin & padding
 We can set margin and padding as follows:
.box {
       Margin  : 3px;
      Padding : 4px;
    }
.box main {
               Margin : 7px(top) 0px(right) 2px(bottom) 11px(left)
                   }
.box last {
        Margin : 7px(top&bottom) 3px(left&right);
We can also set individual margins/paddings like this:
 Margin-top : 7 px;
Margin-bottom : 3px;
Margin-left : 8px;  
Margin-right : 9px;
Note: Same goes with padding

Setting borders
We can set the border as follows
.bx {
     Border-width : 2px;
Border-style : solid;
Border-color : red;

Note : or just set border : 2px solid red; (shorthand)
  }

Border radius
We can set border radius to create rounded borders
.div 2 {
    Border-radius : 7px;

Margin collapse
When two margins from different element overlap, the equivalent margin is the greater of the two. This is called margin collapse
     



Box sizing
Determines what out of padding and border is included in element width and height
Can be content-box or border-box
.div 1 {
Box-sizing : border-box;( The content width and height includes content + padding + border)


Chapter 4­ – font & display

The display property
 The css display property is used to determine whether an element is created as a block/inline element & the layout used for its chindren.(flexbox/grid/etc)
 
Display: inline
Takes only the space required by the element. No line creates before and after. Setting width/height or margin/padding not allowed.
Display: block
Takes full space available in width and leaves a newline before and after the element 
Display: inline-block
Similar to inline but setting  height, width, margin and padding is allowed. Element can sit next to each other
Display : none vs visibility : hidden
With display : none, the element is remove from the document flow. Its space is not blocked.
With visibility : hidden, the element is hidden but its space is reserved.
Text – align property 
Used to sit the horizontal alignment of a text 
    .div 1 {
         Text –align : center;
          }
 Text decoration property 
Used to decorate the text 
Can be overline, line – through, underline, none 
Text – transform property 
Used to spacify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text.
p. uppercase {
          text – transform: uppercase;
line – height property 
Used to spacify the space between lines.
. small {
    Line – height : 0.7;
          }
Font 
Font plays a very important role in the look and feel of a website
Font – family 
Font family specify the font of a text.
Can hold multiple values as a “ fallback ” system
  p.   {
    font – family : “ Times new Roman”, monospace;
Note :  Always do this to ensure the correct font of your choice is rendered
 Web safe fonts
These fonts are universally installed across browers.
How to add Google fonts
In order to use custom Google fonts, go to Google fonts then select a style and finally paste it to the style.css off your page.
  Other font property 
 Some of the other font property is listed below:
 Font – size > sets the size of the font
Font – style >sets the font style
Font – variant >sets whether text is displayed in small-caps
Font – weight >sets the weight of the font
Generic families
Broad class of similar fonts eg.serif, sans-scrif just like when we say fruit, it can be any fruit. When we say serif it can be any serif font.
Font-family >specific
Generic –family >Generic




Chapter 5 – size, position & list


There are more unit for describing size other than ‘px’
There are rem, cm, vw, percentage etc.
What wrong with pixcls?
Pixcls {px} are relative to the viewing device for a device with size 1920, 1px is 1 unit out of 1080/1920.
Relative lengths
There units are relative to the other length property following are some of the most commonly used relative lengths
1. em >  unit relative to the parent font size ( em mean “ my parent element’s font size ” )
2. rem > unit relative to the root font size ( <html/> tag)
3. vw > unit relative to 1% viewport width.
4. vh > unit relative to 1% viewport height.
5. % > unit relative to the parent element.
Min/max – height / width property
CSS has a min – height , max – height , min – width and max width property.
If the content is smaller than the minimum height, minimum height will be applied.
Similar is the case with other related properties
 The position property 
Used to manipulate the location of an element following are the possible values:
    • Static : The default position top/ bottom/ left/ right / z-index has no effect.
    • Relative : The top/bottom/left/right/z-index will now work. Otherwise the element is in the flow of document like static.
    • Absolute : The element is removed from the flow & is relatively positioned to its first non-static ancestor top/bottom etc works
    • Fixed : Just like absolute expect the element is positioned relative to the browser window
    • Sticky : The element is positioned based on user’s scroll position.
 
List-style property 
 The list style property is a shorthand for type, position & image
  Ul {
    list-style : square inside url ( kisan.png )
     }
   Z-index property 
 The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
It defines which layer will be above which in case of overlapping elements
*Z – is the third dimension 








Chapter 6 – Flexbox

Before we look into the css flexbox, we will look into float and clear properties.
The float property 
Float property is simple. It just flows the element toward left/right



The clear property 
Used to clear the float. It specifies what element can float beside a given element.

The CSS Flexbox
Aims at provide a better way to layout, align and distribute space among item in a container.
.container {
     Display : flex;
                  }



 Flex-direction property
 
Defines the direction toward which items are laid can be row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse.

Flex property for parent ( flex container )

Following are the properties for the flex parent :
1. flex-wrap : Can be wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse. Wrap items as needed with this property.
2. Justify-content : Defines alignment along main axis.
3. Align-items : Defines alignment along across axis.
4. Align-content : Aligns a flex container’s lines when there is extra space in the cross axis.


Flex properties for the children ( flex items )
Following are the properties for the flex children.

1. Order : Control the order in which the items appear in the flex container
2. Align-self : Allows default alignment to be overridden for the individual flex items.
3. flex-grow : Defines the ability for a flex item to grow
4. flex-shrink : Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.


Chapter 7 – CSS Grid & Media Queries

A css grid can be initialized using :
.container {
       Display : grid
                   }
All direct children automatically becomes grid items
 
The grid-column-gap property 
Using to adjust the space between the column of a css grid.

The grid-row-gap property 
Used to adjust the space between the rows of a css grid.
The grid-gap property 
Shorthand property for grid-row-gap & grid-column-gap 
.container {
             Display : grid;
   *Note: For a single value of grid-gap , both row and column gaps can be set in one value.

Following are the properties for grid container:
1. The grid-template-column property can be used to specify the width of column
.container {
               Display : grid;
              Grid-template-column : 10px 20px auto;	
                  }
2. The grid-template-row can be used to specify the height of each row
   .container {
             Display : grid;
             Grid-template-row : 70px 150px;  }
3. The justify-content is used to align the whole grid inside the container.
4. The align-content property is used to vertically align the whole grid inside the container.
Following are the property for grid item:
1. The grid-column property defines how many columns an item will span.
                       .grid-item {
                             Grid-column : 1/5;
                                          }
2. The grid-row property defines how many rows an item will span.
3. We can make an item to start on column 1 and span 3 column like this:
     .item {
             Grid-column: 1/span3;
CSS  Media Queries
Used to apply css only when a certain condition is true.
Syntax:
@media {
        Background : red;
                     }








Chapter 8 – Transforms, Transitions & Animations
Transforms are used to rotate, move, skew or scale element. They are used to create a 3d effect 

The transform property 
Used t apply a 2d or 3d transformation to an element 
 The transform-origin property 
Allows to change the position of transformed elements 
2D transforms > Can change x & y axis
3D transforms > Can changes z axis as well

CSS 2D transform methods
You can use the following 2-D transforms in CSS:
1. translate ()
2. rotate()
3. scale X()
4. scaleY()
5. skew()
6. matrix()
7. scale()

CSS Transitions
Used to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

The transition property 
 The transition property is used to add transition in css
Following are the property is used for css transition:
1. transition-property > The property you want to transition.
2. transition-duration > Time for which you want transition to apply
3. transition-timing-function > How you want the property to transition
4. transition-delay > Specifies the delay for the transition

All these properties can be set using a single shorthand property 
Transition : width 35 case-in 25;

Transition multiple properties 
 We can transition multiple properties as follows:
Transition : opacity 1s case-out 1s;  transform 2s case-in;

CSS Animations 
Used to animate css property with more control.
We can use @keyframes rule to change the animation from a given style to a new style.
@keygframes kamalesh {
    From { width: 29px;}
   To { width: 31px;}

Properties to add Animations
Following are the properties used to set animation in css:
1. animation-name > name of the animation
2. animation-duration > How long does the animation run?
3. animation-timing-function > Determines space curve of the animation 
4. animation-delay > Delay for the start of an animation
5. animation-iteration-count > Number of times an animation shad run
6. animation-direction > Specifies the direction of the animation


The animation shorthand
All the animation shorthand properties from 1-6 can be applied like this:
Animation: kama   14   linear    15    infinite    reverse;

Using percentage value states with animation
We can use % value to indicate what should happen when a certain percent of animation is completed
@keyframes kama {
             Width: 20px;
       }
50% {
     Width : 80px;
     }
100% {
    Width : 200px;
    }
       }
