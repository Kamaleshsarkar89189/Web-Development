    talk to a human but for computers. We need straight forward instructions

Computer is Dumb!
    When was the last time you ordered some serial and got DVDs of serial?
    Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise instructioon telling a computer what to do.

    What is Ecmascript?
    ECMA Script is a standard on which Javascript is based. It was created to ensure that different docoments
    or javascript are actually talkling about the same language.

    Javascript & ECMA Script can almost always be used interchangelly JavaScript is very liberal in what it allows.


How to excute JavaScript ?
    Javascript can be executed right inside one's brower, you can open the javascript console and start writing javascript there.

    Another way to excute javascript is a runtime like Note.js which can be installed and used to run javascript code.
    
    Yet another way to execute javascript is by inserting it inside <script> tag of an HTML document.
