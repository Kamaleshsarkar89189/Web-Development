// Variables & Data
/*
Just like we follow some rules while seaking english (the grammer), we have some rules to follow while writing a javascript program. The set of these rules is called syntax in javascript

What is a variable ?
    A variable is a container that stores a value. This is very similar to the containers used to store rice, water and oats (Treat this as an analogy)

    The value of a javascript variable can be changed during the execution of a program

        var a =  8 //literal
        let a = 8 // declaring variables

Rules for choosing variable names
---> Letters, digits, underscore & sing allowed.
---> Must being with a $, or q letter.
---> Javascript & kiSAn are different variable (case sensitive)

var vs let in Javascript:
    1. var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped
    2. var is be updated & re-declared within its scope
    3. let can be updated but not re-declared.
    4. const can neighter be updated nor be re-declared.
    5. var vairables are initialized during declaration nulike  let and var

Primitive Data Types & Objects
    Primitive data types are a set fo basic data types in javascript
    Object is a non primitive datatype in javascript
    
    These are the 7 Primitive datatypes in javascript

Object

    An object in Javascript can be created as follows
        const item = {
            name : "Kamalesh" // value
            price : "120" //value
        }
